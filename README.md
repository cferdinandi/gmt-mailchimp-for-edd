## Getting Started

Getting started with GMT MailChimp is as simple as installing a plugin:

1. Upload the `gmt-mailchimp-for-edd` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPress.

And that's it, you're done. Nice work!

It's recommended that you also install the [GitHub Updater plugin](https://github.com/afragen/github-updater) to get automatic updates.



## Adding a purchaser to a MailChimp list

1. [Create a MailChimp form](https://github.com/cferdinandi/gmt-mailchimp#creating-mailchimp-forms) like you normally would with GMT MailChimp.
2. Under `Easy Digital Downloads Integration`, select a `Download` (product) or `Discount` (discount code) that will cause the buyer to get added to your list.
3. If you don't want them to receive the double opt-in email, check `Disable double opt-in`.
